1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
It's true. I've got a 12 core 3900X at home, and honestly, I don't use all those cores most of the time.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,440
If I didn't dabble with running multiple virtual machines, I'd be just as well off with an 8 core or even a 6 core CPU,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,480
especially if all I wanted to do was game.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,540
In fact, 6 cores is what I went with for my VR rig.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
Sure, there's stuff like compiling code and non-GPU rendering,

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,080
but the reality is that anybody serious enough about coding or graphics to be looking at a Threadripper

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,960
would probably also be looking at a separate build or render box so their workstation isn't unusable while the job's being done.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,500
If, say, I ran a Plex instance, a personal web server, and maybe mess around with a Windows or Mac OS virtual machine,

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,360
that'd be roughly half my dozen cores, and I'd probably be more pressured on memory and storage at that point.

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,780
Now, would I complain if I had 16 cores to play with?

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,880
No.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,540
But I don't need them either. I don't even need what I have now.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,760
By the time I do, pricing for those extra cores, not to mention platform features like PCI Express Gen 5 and DDR5,

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,720
will come down and it'll all be more mature to boot.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,720
The only times I've personally gone for, like, the top-end consumer processors

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,400
were the Core i7-3770K I got with Intel Retail Edge on the cheap,

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,680
and the Core i7-6700K near the tail end of the quad-core-is-all-you-need years,

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,920
so I'd have the extra threads to work with.

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,640
And that's just me comparing my 12 cores to 16, let alone Threadripper with up to 64.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,400
Now, you could argue that Threadripper would stay relevant for way longer than any desktop chip would,

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,080
but you'd be wrong about that.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,740
The 16-core Threadripper 1950X workstation that I use to type this script is slow as balls,

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,340
and I have never once used all the cores.

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,860
I desperately want more IPC and faster memory.

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,000
I'd happily trade for a 5800X or even a 5600X and some fast memory.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not even using more PCI Express lanes than a modern Ryzen desktop can handle.

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,380
And I'm Anthony!
